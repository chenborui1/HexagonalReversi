Simplest strategy choosing a move for Black on the starting board configuration for
A board size of 11. 



MockModelStrategyOne Transcript for Capture most strategy:

-This transcript contains all the method calls when strategy one is executed on
a starting board configuration for board size 11.

To see whether transcript keeps track of the functionality of the strategy visit StrategyMockTests
class where I test whether the transcript contains whether the strategy checked all possible
cells on the board, documenting the correct valuable move when faced with a tie,
and documenting all the legal moves available on the board, etc.
